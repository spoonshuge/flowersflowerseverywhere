## About Me

### Who Am I

I am an **experiential therapist** and **collaborative, relationally-oriented counselor** who seeks to support individuals within their current context. While I make no guarantees about the outcomes of therapy, there are two promises I make to all my clients:

**First Promise:** Because I am a firm believer that you can only take someone as far as you yourself have gone, I will not ask anything of you that I don't ask of myself. Therefore, every technique used in session or trainings is one that I have not only been trained in but also experienced personally.

**Second Promise:** I will not suggest anything that I do not believe will be to your benefit. With that said, I let all my clients know that you always have veto power and all suggestions are invitations.

#### My Journey

Prior to becoming a **Nationally Certified Counselor**, I obtained my psychology degree from **Hendrix College** before moving to Atlanta to attend **Emory University's Candler School of Theology** and earn my **Master of Divinity**. 

Throughout my education, I sought to ground my academic work in community-based service such as:
- Crossroads Community Ministries
- Oakhurst Baptist Church
- Genesis Family Shelter

After graduating from theology school and serving as program developer and administrator in the non-profit sector, I realized that I wanted to work more closely with individuals and chose to return to school to earn my **Master's Degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling** at **Mercer University**. 

I then completed my training and early clinical experience at Genesis Family Shelter and Compass Consulting. These days, I enjoy working with clients, especially in intensives, and providing experiential consultation and training to those hoping to bring more action into their therapeutic practice.

Rather than providing traditional talk therapy, I integrate practices of mindfulness and experiential approaches such as:

- **Psychodrama**

- **Music Therapy**
- **Improvisation**
- **Sand Tray Therapy**
- **Brainspotting**
- **Play Therapy**

- Participants are encouraged to use evenings to rest, relax, and connect with themselves to best integrate the work done during the day

### 👥 Therapy Groups

Groups are just as therapeutic as individual sessions and provide the added opportunity for connection with peers. Like individual sessions, therapy groups are experiential in nature.

### 🏥 Do you take insurance?

I am a **private-pay practice**, and do not currently accept insurance. However, several clients seek reimbursement through "out-of-network" coverage. 

I encourage all clients to check with their benefits to see if services are eligible for reimbursement. If so, I am happy to provide you with a **"super bill"** which can be submitted to your insurance company for potential reimbursement.

---

### 💳 What forms of payment do you accept?

I use a platform called **Simple Practice** where you will be able to set up billing information through a client portal. At the time of the session, the credit/debit card on file will be charged unless alternative forms of payment have been previously agreed upon. 

**Accepted Payment Methods:**
- Credit/Debit Card (via Simple Practice)
- Cash
- Check
- Venmo
- PayPal

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Do you work with couples or families?

Because I have found that multiple therapy participants are best served in more intensive healing settings, I only work with **couples in intensive settings** such as 2-4 day intensives. 

I do offer **family sessions** in 90-120 minute blocks.
