About Me
	•	Who Am I
	•	I am an experiential therapist and collaborative, relationally-oriented counselor who seeks to support individuals within their current context. While I make no guarantees about the outcomes of therapy, there are two promises I make to all my clients. Because I am a firm believer that you can only take someone as far as you yourself have gone, the first promise is that I will not ask anything of you that I don’t ask of myself. Therefore, every technique used in session or trainings is one that I have not only been trained in but also experienced personally. The second is that I will not suggest anything that I do not believe will be to your benefit. With that said, I let all my clients know that you always have veto power and all suggestions are invitations. 
	•	Prior to becoming a Nationally Certified Counselor, I obtained my psychology degree from Hendrix College before moving to Atlanta to attend Emory University’s Candler School of Theology and earn my Master of Divinity. Throughout my education, I sought to ground my academic work in community-based service such as Crossroads Community Ministries, Oakhurst Baptist Church, and Genesis Family Shelter. After graduating from theology school and serving as program developer and administrator in the non-profit sector, I realized that I wanted to work more closely with individuals and chose to return to school to earn my Master’s Degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at Mercer University. I then completed my training and early clinical experience at Genesis Family Shelter and Compass Consulting. These days, I enjoy working with clients, especially in intensives, and providing experiential consultation and training to those hoping to bring more action into their therapeutic practice. 
	•	Areas of Focus
	•	Individuals, Children, Adolescents, and Adults; Women’s Issues and Relational Concerns; Grief & Loss; Trauma; Creative Counseling Therapy; Groups; Substance Abuse and Recovery Promotion; Parenting; Depression and Anxiety; Adjustment to Life Transitions; Mindfulness; Spirituality.
	•	My Approach
	•	I use experiential modalities to integrate humanistic, existential, and systems theories with cognitive, behavioral, and solution-focused techniques. I seek to work with clients to identify strengths, better utilize available resources, and work through challenges that pose obstacles to fulfilling life and relationships. Rather than providing traditional talk therapy, I integrate practices of mindfulness and experiential approaches such as psychodrama, art, music, improvisation, sand tray, Brainspotting, and play therapies.
Services
	•	Individual Therapy
	•	Individual therapy is best for those who are able and willing to make an ongoing regular commitment to healing work. Individual sessions are scheduled for 60, 90, and 120-minute intervals on a weekly or biweekly basis. 
	•	Individual, Couples, & Family Intensives
	•	Intensives are ideal for individuals, couples, and families seeking deep, concentrated healing work beyond what weekly therapy sessions can offer. Intensives provide the time and space needed to explore and address issues on a profound level lasting anywhere from 1-4 days, with 6-8 hours of healing work done every day. Participants are encouraged to use evenings to rest, relax, and connect with themselves to best integrate the work done during the day.
	•	Therapy Groups
	•	Groups are just as therapeutic as individual sessions and provide the added opportunity for connection with peers. Like individual sessions, therapy groups are experiential in nature.
	•	Experiential Consultation
	•	To help those who are new to experiential modalities, I provide 60-minute consultation sessions to explore what experiential tools can be easily incorporated into work with clients and teams.

	•	Do you take insurance?
	•	I am a private-pay practice, and do not currently accept insurance. However, several clients seek reimbursement through “out-of-network” coverage. I encourage all clients to check with their benefits to see if services are eligible for reimbursement. If so, I am happy to provide you with a “super bill” which can be submitted to your insurance company for potential reimbursement.
	•	 What forms of payment do you accept?
	•	I use a platform called Simple Practice where you will be able to set up billing information through a client portal. At the time of the session, the credit/debit card on file will be charged unless alternative forms of payment have been previously agreed upon. Cash, check, Venmo, and PayPal are also accepted forms of payment.
	•	Do you work with couples or families?
	•	Because I have found that multiple therapy participants are best served in more intensive healing settings, I only work with couples in intensive settings such as 2-4 day intensives. I do offer family sessions in 90-120 minute blocks. 
	•	Where are you located?
	•	My physical office is located at 6065 Lake Forrest Drive NW, Suite 250, Sandy Springs, GA 30328 in a building that requires stairs to access my office on the second floor. Therefore, for those who have mobility issues, virtual sessions and home visits are available. 
	•	What is the next step if I have more questions or am unsure?
	•	You can schedule a free 15-minute consultation. Request a consult here.
